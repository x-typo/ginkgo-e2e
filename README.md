# Ginkgo E2E Test Suite (under construct)

## Technologies Used:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/) - A statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and performance.
- [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) - A powerful BDD-style testing framework for Go, ideal for expressive and structured test suites.
- [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) - A robust matcher/assertion library that complements Ginkgo for fluent test writing.
